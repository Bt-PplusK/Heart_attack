# Heart_attack_risk_prediction

Project_Overview

This project utilizes Docker to develop and deploy a heart attack risk prediction model using machine learning. By leveraging Docker containers, we ensure a consistent and reproducible environment for building, training, and deploying the model. This project aims to:

Assess and predict the risk of heart attacks: We analyze various factors associated with cardiovascular disease and utilize machine learning to identify individuals at high risk.
Promote preventative measures: By understanding individual risk profiles, we can encourage individuals to take proactive steps to improve their heart health and reduce their risk of heart attacks.
Contribute to research: This project contributes to the ongoing research efforts in cardiovascular disease prediction and diagnosis.

Technology_Stack

Programming language: Python (e.g., scikit-learn libraries)
Docker containerization platform
Machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (and potentially more)
Data pre-processing techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, scaling
Model evaluation metrics: AUC score, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Docker Image and Usage
The project provides a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image containing all the necessary dependencies and libraries for running the heart attack risk prediction model. Users can easily build and run the model by executing simple Docker commands.
